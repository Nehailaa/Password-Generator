# Password-Generator


In this projects, I used various Javascript concepts to create this password generator like:

- Using flexbox to center elements.
- Using CSS grid to create layouts.
- Using charcodes.
- The ability to bind click and input events in JavaScript.


*I also created the form in HTML and ulize it for a better layout and options for the user.*

In this projects, the following were used:

- HTML.
- CSS.
- JAVASCRIPT.
